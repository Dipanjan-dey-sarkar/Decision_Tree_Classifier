# Decision_Tree_Classifier

In this project, we are using a Decision Tree classifier to predict the labels of the given Iris dataset.
Upon completion of modeling, we are creating new datapoints on which the prediction of the model is done.
We have also used tree module from sklearn for visualizing our model graphically.
